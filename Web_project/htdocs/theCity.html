		The Bear Creek Trail, Hinkson Creek Trail, and MKT Trail are the premier multi-use trails in Columbia. These 10-ft. wide trails with crushed 
		limestone surfaces are good for walking, jogging, and biking. County House Trail and the South Providence Trail were added to the trail system
		in 2011.<br>
		The Hominy Creek Trail (Phase I) and Scott's Branch Trail were added in 2013. These trails are constructed out of concrete to reduce 
		maintenance costs and provide consistent trail conditions. County House, South Providence, and Hominy Creek Trails have an alternative gravel 
		side path along portions of the concrete trail.<br>
