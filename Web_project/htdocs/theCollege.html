<p><<h2> Columbia College </h2></p>
<p><article>
		Founded in 1851, Columbia College has been helping students advance their lives through higher education
		for more than 160 years.  As a private, nonprofit, coeducational, liberal arts and science college, the college
		takes pride in its small classes, experienced faculty and quality educational programs.<br>
		Originally founded as Christian Female College, the college was the first woman's college west of the
		Mississippi river to be chartered by a state legislature.  The college changed its name to Columbia College in
		1970 when it transitioned from a two-year women's college to a four-year coeducational college.  Though
		Columbia College has retained a covenant with the Christian Church since its inception, the college
		is a nonsectarian school welcoming students of all religious denominations.<br>
		Through its network of campuses in 34 nationwide locations, the Day Campus and Evening Campus in
		Columbia, MO., and the Online Campus, the college serves more than 31,000 students annually.<br>
		In addition to offering associate and bachelor's degrees, the college also offers master's degrees at the main 
		campus, selected extended campuses and online.<br></p>
